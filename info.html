                <h2>What is Collapse?</h2>
                <p class="text-respon">Collapse, in this context, refers to the significant loss of an established level or complexity towards a much simpler state. It can occur differently within many areas, orderly or chaotically, and be willing or unwilling. It does not
                    necessarily imply human extinction or a singular, global event. Although, the longer the duration, the more it resembles a ‘decline’ instead of collapse.</p>

                    <p class="text-respon">“The difference between my view and that of many others in the collapse field is that a lot of them assume that the first wave of crisis will be followed by total collapse, and I argue that it’ll be followed by muddling through and
                        partial recovery, then by renewed crisis, and so on. Thus I don’t think it’s actually that useful to have a single metric for what counts as collapse, because collapse is a process, not an event; the collapse of industrial civilization
                        has been under way for quite some time now, and will still be a going concern for longer than any of us will be alive.”- <em>John Michael Greer</em></p>

                <p class="text-respon">Energy can only be substituted by other energy. Conventional economic thinking on most depletable resources considers substitution possibilities as essentially infinite. But not all joules perform equally. There is a large difference between
                    potential and kinetic energy. Energy properties such as: intermittence, variability, energy density, power density, spatial distribution, energy return on energy invested, scalability, transportability, etc. make energy substitution
                    a complex prospect. The ability of a technology to provide ‘joules’ is different than its ability to contribute to ‘work’ for society. All joules do not contribute equally to human economies.<a href="https://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/MAHBBlog_WhereAreWeGoing40ShadesOfGray_NHagens_May2018.pdf">1</a>,

                <p class="text-respon">Even if every renewable energy technology advanced as quickly as imagined and they were all applied globally, atmospheric CO2 levels wouldn’t just remain above 350 ppm; they would continue to rise exponentially due to continued fossil
                    fuel use. So our best-case scenario, which was based on our most optimistic forecasts for renewable energy, would still result in severe climate change. Reversing the trend would require both radical technological advances in cheap
                    zero-carbon energy, as well as a method of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere and sequestering the carbon.<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/renewables/what-it-would-really-take-to-reverse-climate-change">1</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals">2</a>                    The speed and scale of transitions and of technological change required to limit warming to 1.5°C has been observed in the past within specific sectors and technologies. But the geographical and economic scales at which the required
                    rates of change in the energy, land, urban, infrastructure and industrial systems would need to take place, are larger and have no documented historic precedent.<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/sr15/sr15_draft.pdf">3</a></p>

                <p class="text-respon">Perspectives vary widely in regard to the actual timeframes of collapse. Joseph Tainter has stated it must be rapid or last no more than a few decades and involve substantial simplifications to society to constitute a collapse. Losses
                    which are less severe or take longer are considered cases of weakness or decline. We can still observe non-linear or isolated instances of collapse within a system, as long as we are aware of the distinctions.</p>

                    by cycles of breakdown (catabolism) and buildup (anabolism).</p>

                <p class="text-respon">The inevitability of collapse is widely disputed and distinctions are difficult to make in terms of the potential or ability of humans to change their conscious or unconscious behaviors leading to specific outcomes. Collapse is certainly
                    inevitable if we continue down our default path. Our ability to conceive of the inevitability or probability rests deeply within our basis of understanding collapse and numerous factors feeding into it.</p>

                    <p class="text-respon">“To make the case for the imminent collapse of global industrial civilization, it is necessary to prove two things. The first is to account for the Earth’s finite endowment of fossil fuels, metal ores, other industrial and agricultural
                        inputs, fresh water and fertile soil, and to demonstrate that many of these resources are either past their all-time peak of production or will soon achieve it. The second is to prove that, as these resources become too scarce
                        to allow the global industrial economy to grow, the result will be collapse rather than a slow and steady deterioration that could continue for centuries without reaching any conclusive, historical endpoint.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon">While the first task is a relatively simple matter of laying out the numbers, which are available from reputable sources that are difficult to argue against and can be grasped by anyone with a head for numbers and a general understanding
                        of the functioning of industrial economies, the second task is much harder, because the only way to address it is through mathematical models. The first of these models is the World3 model used in the 1972 book Limits to Growth.
                        World3 is a relatively simple model that ran on a computer less powerful than a smartphone and included just five variables: world population, industrialization, pollution, food production and resource depletion. This model predicted
                        economic and societal collapse by mid-twenty-first century. The 2004 Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update3 confirmed that, thirty years later, the initial predictions are still in excellent agreement with reality. Though your instinct
                        may be to mistrust the predictive abilities of mathematical models in general, this wariness should be tempered somewhat when the model in question is shown to have been correct decades later” - <em>Dmitry Orlov</em></p>

                        Power Principle.

                    <p class="text-respon">These flows of energy and resources can be thought of as “stocks” and “sinks”. Stocks are accumulations of resources, and sinks are accumulations of wastes. Sometimes these flows of energy and resources become organized in such a way

                    <p class="text-respon">Any system can only grow to the extent it does not exhaust its accumulations of resources or to the extent it does not overwhelm the capacity of it’s sinks. This the basis of the concept of carrying capacity, or ability of a given
                        environment or ecosystem to support a species sustainably by providing stocks and flows of resources and safely absorbing accumulations of wastes.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon">The very definition of “sustainable” is to stay within the long term carrying capacity of your environment by not over-exploiting resources and over-accumulating wastes.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon">It is possible to overshoot the long term carrying capacity of your environment by over-exploiting large stocks of accumulated resources. This temporarily increases short term carrying capacity by enabling population growth above what
                        would otherwise be sustainable by the long term carrying capacity. Once these resources are exhausted, the excess population which was enabled by the consumption of these finite stocks becomes redundant and dies off or collapses.

                    <p class="text-respon">Fossil Fuels have supplied such a high quality and quantity of energy it has enabled the rampant growth of both our population and exploitation of many other resources on our planet. This has also grossly overwhelmed the ability of

                <p class="text-respon">Coping with the reality of collapse is an ongoing process. Many of the resources, articles, and perspectives shared here do not adequately engage the psychological or spiritual implications of this predicament. Managing our intake of information
                    and remaining aware of our mental health throughout this process is critical, as anxiety and depression are natural reactions. <a href="https://carolynbaker.net/2012/10/20/climbing-the-ladder-of-awareness-by-paul-chefurka/">Paul Chefurka shared his perspectives</a>                    on the various stages of awareness and how we may react throughout them:</p>
                <p class="text-respon">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-respon text-cyan"><strong>Dead Asleep</strong></p>
                <p class="text-respon">At this stage there seem to be no fundamental problems, just some shortcomings in human organization, behavior and morality which can be fixed with the proper attention to rule-making. People at this stage tend to live their lives happily,
                    with occasional outbursts of annoyance around election times or the quarterly corporate earnings seasons.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-respon text-cyan"><strong>Awareness of One Fundamental Problem</strong></p>
                <p class="text-respon">Whether it&#39;s climate change, overpopulation, peak oil, chemical pollution, oceanic over-fishing, biodiversity loss, corporatism, economic instability or sociopolitical injustice, one problem seems to engage the attention completely.
                    People at this stage tend to become ardent activists for their chosen cause. They tend to be very vocal about their personal issue, and blind to any others.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-respon text-cyan"><strong>Awareness of Many Problems</strong></p>
                <p class="text-respon">As people let in more evidence from different domains, the awareness of complexity begins to grow. At this point a person worries about the prioritization of problems in terms of their immediacy and degree of impact. People at this stage
                    may become reluctant to acknowledge new problems - for example, someone who is committed to fighting for social justice and against climate change may not recognize the problem of resource depletion. They may feel that the problem
                    space is already complex enough, and the addition of any new concerns will only dilute the effort that needs to be focused on solving the &quot;highest priority&quot; problem.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-respon text-cyan"><strong>Awareness of the Interconnections Between the Many Problems</strong></p>
                <p class="text-respon">The realization that a solution in one domain may worsen a problem in another marks the beginning of large-scale system-level thinking. It also marks the transition from thinking of the situation in terms of a set of problems to thinking
                    of it in terms of a predicament. At this point the possibility that there may not be a solution begins to raise its head.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">People who arrive at this stage tend to withdraw into tight circles of like-minded individuals in order to trade insights and deepen their understanding of what&#39;s going on. These circles are necessarily small, both because personal
                    dialogue is essential for this depth of exploration, and because there just aren&#39;t very many people who have arrived at this level of understanding.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-respon text-cyan"><strong>Awareness the Predicament Encompasses All Aspects of Life</strong></p>
                <p class="text-respon">This includes everything we do, how we do it, our relationships with each other, as well as our treatment of the rest of the biosphere and the physical planet. With this realization, the floodgates open, and no problem is exempt from consideration
                    or acceptance. The very concept of a &quot;Solution&quot; is seen through, and cast aside as a waste of effort.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="text-respon">Where do you fall on this scale? Answering this question is the first step to orienting yourself. For those who arrive at the last stage there is a real risk depression will set in. After all, we&#39;ve learned throughout our lives our
                    hope for tomorrow lies in our ability to solve problems today. When no amount of human cleverness appears able to solve our predicament the possibility of hope can vanish like a the light of a candle flame, to be replaced by the suffocating
                    darkness of despair.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">How people cope with despair is of course deeply personal, but it seems to me there are two general routes people take to reconcile themselves with the situation. These are not mutually exclusive, and most of us will operate out of some
                    mix of the two. I identify them here as general tendencies, because people seem to be drawn more to one or the other. I call them the outer path and the inner path.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">If one is inclined to choose the outer path, concerns about adaptation and local resilience move into the foreground, as exemplified by the Transition Network and Permaculture Movement. To those on the outer path, community-building and
                    local sustainability initiatives will have great appeal. Organized party politics seems to be less attractive to people at this stage, however. Perhaps politics is seen as part of the problem, or perhaps it&#39;s just seen as a waste
                    of effort when the real action will take place at the local level.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">Choosing the inner path involves re-framing the whole thing in terms of consciousness, self-awareness and/or some form of transcendent perception. For someone on this path it is seen as an attempt to manifest Gandhi&#39;s message, &quot;Become
                    the change you wish to see in the world,&quot; on the most profoundly personal level. This message is similarly expressed in the ancient Hermetic saying, &quot;As above, so below.&quot; Or in plain language, &quot;In order to heal
                    the world, first begin by healing yourself.&quot;</p>
                <p class="text-respon">However, the inner path does not imply a &quot;retreat into religion&quot;. Most of the people I&#39;ve met who have chosen an inner path have as little use for traditional religion as their counterparts on the outer path have for traditional
                    politics. Organized religion is usually seen as part of the predicament rather than a valid response to it. Those who have arrived at this point have no interest in hiding from or easing the painful truth, rather they wish to create
                    a coherent personal context for it. Personal spirituality of one sort or another often works for this, but organized religion rarely does.</p>
                <p class="text-respon">It&#39;s worth mentioning that there is also the possibility of a serious personal difficulty at this point. If someone cannot choose an outer path for whatever reasons, and is also resistant to the idea of inner growth or spirituality
                    as a response the the crisis of an entire planet, then they are truly in a bind. There are few other doorways out of this depth of despair. If one remains stuck here for an extended period of time, life can begin to seem awfully bleak,
                    and violence against either the world or oneself may begin begin to seem like a reasonable option. Please keep a watchful eye on your own progress, and if you encounter someone else who may be in this state, please offer them a supportive
                    ear.

                <h2>Barriers</h2>
                <p class="text-respon ">There are numerous barriers to developing an understanding of collapse. Despite how obvious some of these may seem, an awareness of them helps to navigate them and be more tolerant of others, regardless of what stage we are at.</p>
                <h4>Ignorance</h4>
                <p class="text-respon">Ignorance is the most prominent barrier to understanding. It should not be confused with ‘nescience’ or a state of not knowing because knowledge is entirely absent or unattainable. Ignorance involves a conscious choice or series of choices
                    to disregard information and develop an understanding of it. </p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Societal conditioning compels us to avoid any information which would disturb our sense of equanimity. Fear of personal responsibility and the inability to face present or future suffering are major triggers of this form of psychological
                    resistance. Courage is required to venture through the unknown towards the reality of our predicament.</p>
                <h4>Denial</h4>
                <p class="text-respon ">Denial occurs after we have taken in information and consciously reject it to avoid an uncomfortable truth. William Catton termed this behavior ‘ostrichism’ or the strategy of sticking your head in the figurative sand and expecting an
                    issue to go away or persistent belief nothing will change and refusal to face facts.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">A recent theory of mind proposes it may have been central to our development as a species. Ajit Varki and Danny Brower’s “Mind Over Reality Transition” (MORT) theory provides significant reasoning for our trajectory to date. They suggest
                    we have succeeded as a species due in large part to an evolved denial of reality, but this behavior is now a disadvantage and preventing a majority of us from recognizing and acting on systemic issues such as climate change and overshoot.

                <h4>Apathy</h4>
                <p class="text-respon ">We’re referring to generalized apathy, not the diagnosed syndrome, versions with a biological basis, or forms of depression. Apathy is traditionally defined by lack of motivation or feeling and can result from emotional desensitization,
                    fear of failure, or habitualized acceptance of boredom. </p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Apathy can develop as a defense mechanism to guard ourselves from failure or confrontation. In certain cases, acting as though nothing really matters is the path of least resistance. It can also be a response to ‘apocalypse fatigue’, a
                    term coined by George Will to describe the media’s fixation on framing issues in eschatological terms. Overexposure to this information or portrayals of distant suffering can trigger guilt or disconnect from the contexts presented,
                    regardless of how capable one is from acting on them or supporting others who are able to do so.</p>

                <h4>Complexity</h4>
                <p class="text-respon ">Understanding the underlying causes and nature of our predicament is extremely challenging. Collapse is a concept against which our human brains are almost incapable of reacting to. It is complex, abstract, in the future, extremely scary,
                    and we currently lack the ability to collectively agree how to solve it.</p>

                    <p class="text-respon ">“None of this should prevent us from cultivating an interest in collapse, as we all start out from a place of ignorance about any subject, but collapse relies heavily on systems theory and so we can&#39;t point to one work, person,
                        or perspective as &quot;the best&quot; since we have to look at as many perspectives as possible and they way they interact.” - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Dave37 ">Dave37</a> in response the to the <a href="https://resslx.typeform.com/to/uG5MJW ">Collapse Survey</a></p>

                <h4>Hope</h4>
                <p class="text-respon ">Hope is a belief in or expectation of some future outcome. Depending on the likelihood and variety of what we wish to occur it prevents us from seeing a clear picture of the future and taking action to address present circumstances. The
                    variations of hope are better explored through the perspectives of individual beliefs surrounding the future and covered in the next section. </p>

                        hoping the situation will somehow not get worse, then we are finally free—truly free—to honestly start working to thoroughly resolve it. I would say when hope dies, action begins.”- <a href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/beyond-hope/ ">Beyond Hope by Derrick Jensen article in Orion Magazine (2006)</a>“Clive
                        Hamilton in his Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth About Climate Change describes a dark relief that comes from accepting that &quot;catastrophic climate change is virtually certain.&quot; This obliteration of &quot;false
                        hopes,&quot; he says, requires an intellectual knowledge and an emotional knowledge. The first is attainable. The second, because it means that those we love, including our children, are almost certainly doomed to insecurity, misery
                        and suffering within a few decades, if not a few years, is much harder to acquire. To emotionally accept impending disaster, to attain the gut-level understanding that the power elite will not respond rationally to the devastation
                        of the ecosystem, is as difficult to accept as our own mortality. The most daunting existential struggle of our time is to ingest this awful truth -- intellectually and emotionally -- and rise up to resist the forces that are destroying

                    <p class="text-respon ">“One problem with hoping things will be OK is that it means we give up our agency. We assume someone will fix things. That is what some call “passive hope.” Meanwhile, any unrealistic hope steals possibility, by wasting the precious
                        time we have to attempt to reduce harm and save humanity. So the problem with proponents of the hope that “we can fix this” is that it makes taboo the needed conversations about what to do given that we can’t fix things. That is
                        what we could call “magical hope”, as it often comes with an overt or implicit suggestion that we can make the reality evolve according to moments where we are choosing to hope (as an aside: if we are co-creating our reality through
                        our consciousness then it is through every moment of attention, not just those moments when we choose to pull ourselves together and do some magical hoping). In distinction to passive hope some have called for an “active hope”
                        where we drop mainstream or received ideas of hope and instead face what we think is reality and construct a new hope based on what we believe in. That is a powerful rethinking of what hope means, as it makes us realize that hope
                        involves actions to make it real. But I don’t think it is a sufficient reworking of the concept of hope. Because it can downplay whether we really think our actions will add up to the outcome we are actively hoping for. Instead,
                        the emphasis is on intention, without being precise about the nature of intention, such as love, compassion, forgiveness, and so on. Therefore, people who speak of “active hope” may actually be practicing magical hope, and avoiding
                        either deeper inquiry into the intentions they value or into the implications of the futility of their actions.” - <a href="https://jembendell.wordpress.com/2019/01/09/hope-and-vision-in-the-face-of-collapse-the-4th-r-of-deep-adaptation/ ">Hope and Vision in the Face of Collapse article by Jem Bendell (2019)</a></p>

                        means, hope is inherently intolerable of the present. The present is never good enough. Our time requires of us to be hope free. To burn through the false choice between hopeful and hopeless… it’s the same con job. We don’t require

                    between utopian and dystopian (i.e. pessimistic and optimistic) perspectives. The examples which follow are some of the most commonly held convictions.</p>

                    Techno-optimism is especially common and the subnotion technology will always save us or technological innovation will stave off collapse. Both stem from our inability to fully conceive of the risks and negative aspects of future technology

                <h4>Pessimism</h4>
                <p class="text-respon ">Pessimism is the general attitude or belief a specific endeavor or outcomes in general will be negative and undesirable. It is marked by the tendency to see the worst aspects of things or believe the worst will happen. Defeatism can be
                    linked to pessimism and is the acceptance of defeat without struggle, often with negative connotations. It can also be related to determinism, fatalism, or the belief we have no power to influence the future or our own actions. Pessimism
                    should remain distinct from cynicism, which has more marked philosophical origins. Modern cynicism is more defined by a distrust of others’ motives and belief individuals will act solely based on self interest.</p>

                    someone who either actively strives against both optimistic and pessimistic tendencies or someone who has reach a degree of acceptance with the possibility of extremely negative outcomes. Realism is a difficult road and involves agitating
                    for the best option while still preparing for the worst. It can also be used as a form of shorthand to dismiss any perceivably ignorant or naive belief in opposition to what we perceive as the systemic and wicked problems inherent
                    to our predicament.</p>

                <p class="text-respon ">McPherson is best known for his many predictions regarding imminent global collapse or near term extinction (NTE), as he has termed it. He first gained notoriety in the mid 2000s by predicting the end of civilization in under a decade

                        to have meaning. The meaning is not explicable to those unable or unwilling to develop a loving relationship with the living planet. Even rudimentary understanding is beyond most people embedded within a culture that refers to
                        relationships as resources.</p>

                        a dent in the climate-change predicament. I am suggesting it can make a difference in the lives of most people.</p>

                <p class="text-respon ">Hansen is best known for his research in climatology, his 1988 Congressional testimony on climate change that helped raise broad awareness of global warming, and his advocacy of action to avoid dangerous climate change. In recent years
                    he has become a climate activist to mitigate the effects of climate change, on a few occasions leading to his arrest.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">After graduate school, Hansen worked with radiative transfer models, attempting to understand the Venusian atmosphere. Later he applied and refined these models to understand the Earth’s atmosphere, in particular, the effects that aerosols
                    and trace gases have on Earth’s climate. Hansen’s development and use of global climate models has contributed to the further understanding of the Earth’s climate. In 2009 his first book, Storms of My Grandchildren, was published.
                    In 2012 he presented a TED Talk: Why I must speak out about climate change.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">As of 2014, Hansen directs the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions at Columbia University’s Earth Institute. The program is working to continue to “connect the dots” from advancing basic climate science to promoting public
                    awareness to advocating policy actions.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Hansen is representing his granddaughter as well as “future generations” as plaintiffs in the Juliana v. US lawsuit, which is suing the United States government and some of its executive branch’s positions for not protecting a stable climate
                    system.
                </p>
                <p class="text-respon ">In 2007, Hansen alleged that in 2005 NASA administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the causes of climate change. Hansen said that NASA public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and
                    interviews after a December 2005 lecture at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. NASA responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with
                    the public affairs office without exception. Two years after Hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political appointees, the agency’s inspector general confirmed that
                    such activities had taken place, with the NASA Office of Public Affairs having “reduced, marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public”.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">In June 2006, Hansen appeared on 60 Minutes stating that the George W. Bush White House had edited climate-related press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening. He also stated he was unable to
                    speak freely without the backlash of other government officials, and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Hansen and 1251 other activists were arrested in August and September 2011, at another demonstration in front of the White House. Hansen urged President Obama to reject the Keystone pipeline extension intended to carry more synthetic crude
                    oil from Canada’s Athabasca Tar Sands to the Gulf of Mexico. On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., during a further protest against the proposed Keystone
                    pipeline extension.</p>

                <p class="text-respon ">Tainter is best known for his book The Collapse of Complex Societies (1988) where he examines the nature of collapse through numerous ancient civilizations. Tainter argues the collapse of a society follows from the success or failure of
                    its problem-solving institutions and occurs when their investments in social complexity and energy subsidies reach a point of diminishing returns. From Tainter’s perspective, we are likely already past the tipping point towards collapse,
                    but just don’t know it yet.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“Sustainability requires that people have the ability and the inclination to think broadly in terms of time and space. In other words, to think broadly in a geographical sense about the world around them, as well as the state of the
                        world as a whole. And also, to think broadly in time in terms of the near and distant future and what resources will be available to our children and our grandchildren and our great grandchildren.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">One of the major problems in sustainability and in this whole question of resources and collapse is that we did not evolve as a species to have this ability to think broadly in time and space. Instead, our ancestors who lived as hunter-gatherers
                        never confronted any challenges that required them to think beyond their locality and the near term(…)</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">We have developed the most complex society humanity has ever known. And we have maintained it up to this point. I have argued that technological innovation and other kinds of innovation evolve like any other aspect of complexity. The
                        investments in research and development grow increasingly complex and reach diminishing returns. We cannot forever continue to spend more and more on technological innovation when we’ve reached the point of diminishing returns,
                        which I argue we have reached.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Our system of innovation is going to change very significantly over the next twenty to thirty to fifty years or so. By the end of the century, our system of innovation will not be anything like what we know today. It will have to be
                        very different. And it’s likely that innovation is not going to be able to solve our problems as readily as it has done to this point.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">The technological optimists have assumed that the productivity of innovation is either constant or increasing. And in fact, what I think my colleagues and I can show is that the productivity of innovation is actually decreasing. What
                        that means is that we will not forever be able to solve resource problems through innovation(…)</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">And so individuals need to take responsibility for their own ignorance. As I said, our species did not evolve to think broadly in terms of time and space and if we’re going to maintain our way of life, people have to learn to do so.
                        People have to take responsibility for knowing and understanding the predicament that we’re facing. I have argued over the last few years that we need to start teaching early school age children in K to 12 to think differently,
                        to think broadly in terms of time and space – to think historically, to think long-term about the future, to think broadly about what’s going on in the world around us instead of the narrow way – the narrow, local way – that most
                        people live and think. So I put responsibility on individuals to broaden their knowledge.”</p>

                <p class="text-respon ">Anderson has a decade’s industrial experience, principally in the petrochemical industry. He sits as commissioner on the Welsh Government&#39;s climate change commission and is a director of Greenstone Carbon Management – a London-based

                <p class="text-respon ">Anderson’s work on carbon budgets has been pivotal in revealing the widening gulf between political rhetoric on climate change and the reality of rapidly escalating emissions. His work emphasizes there is now little to no chance of keeping
                    the rise in global mean surface temperature below 4°C, as early as 2050, despite repeated high-level statements to the contrary.“Despite [five] IPCC reports, 23 rounds of international negotiations, and thousands of climate change
                    papers and conferences, annual emissions are more than 60% higher than in 1990, and are still rising. Put simply, the international community has presided over a quarter of a century of abject failure to deliver any meaningful reduction
                    in absolute global emissions.”</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Anderson has concluded only a planned economic downturn accompanied by severe energy austerity by the one percent who use 50% of the world’s energy can avoid a climate disaster. He has also accused too many climate scientists of keeping
                    quiet about the unrealistic assessments put out by governments and regularly criticized our own overconfidence on the promise of new technologies to forgo our predicament.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“Certainly the rhetoric of action is ramping up. Yet those who talk confidently about renewables, nuclear and “carbon capture and storage” (CCS) eventually driving down emissions in decades to come are guilty of misunderstanding the
                        fundamental science of climate change.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-respon ">We face a “cumulative problem”, with rising temperatures relating to the build up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Based on this, the Paris 1.5°C and 2°C commitments demand total emissions remain within a small and rapidly dwindling
                    “carbon budget”. Time is truly of the essence. Less than 12 years of current emissions will see our 1.5°C aspiration go the way of the dodo, with the 2°C carbon budget exceeded by the mid 2030s.”</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“Of course, ignoring the systemic nature of our dilemma just means that as soon as we get one symptom corralled, another is likely to break loose. But, crucially, is climate change, taken as an isolated problem, fully treatable with
                        technology? Color me doubtful. I say this having spent many months poring over the relevant data with David Fridley of the energy analysis program at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Our resulting book, Our Renewable Future,
                        concluded that nuclear power is too expensive and risky; meanwhile, solar and wind power both suffer from intermittency, which (once these sources begin to provide a large percentage of total electrical power) will require a combination
                        of three strategies on a grand scale: energy storage, redundant production capacity and demand adaptation. At the same time, we in industrial nations will have to adapt most of our current energy usage (which occurs in industrial
                        processes, building heating and transportation) to electricity. Altogether, the energy transition promises to be an enormous undertaking, unprecedented in its requirements for investment and substitution. When David and I stepped
                        back to assess the enormity of the task, we could see no way to maintain current quantities of global energy production during the transition, much less to increase energy supplies so as to power ongoing economic growth. The biggest
                        transitional hurdle is scale: the world uses an enormous amount of energy currently; only if that quantity can be reduced significantly, especially in industrial nations, could we imagine a credible pathway toward a post-carbon
                        future.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“The ecological argument is, at its core, a moral one—as I explain in more detail in a just-released manifesto replete with sidebars and graphics (“There’s No App for That: Technology and Morality in the Age of Climate Change, Overpopulation,
                        and Biodiversity Loss”). Any systems thinker who understands overshoot and prescribes powerdown as a treatment is effectively engaging in an intervention with an addictive behavior. Society is addicted to growth, and that’s having
                        terrible consequences for the planet and, increasingly, for us as well. We have to change our collective and individual behavior and give up something we depend on—power over our environment. We must restrain ourselves, like an
                        alcoholic foreswearing booze. That requires honesty and soul-searching.”</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">Smil has spent his career exploring the fields of energy, environmental and population change, food production and nutrition, technical innovation, risk assessment and public policy and is widely regarded as one of the most important thinkers
                    of our time. He has published forty books and over 500 papers, worked as a consultant for many US, EU and international institutions, and lectured at many conferences and universities around the world.He was named one of Foreign Policy’s
                    Top 100 Global Thinkers of 2010 and received an OPEC Award in 2015 for his research on energy.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Smil’s range of expertise is expansive. In 2013 alone, he published four books on a wide array of global issues. Harvesting the Biosphere looked at the extent in which we exploit the world’s resources for food and raw materials. Should
                    We Eat Meat? provided a systematic look at the evolution of human carnivorism and modern meat production. Made in the USA: The Rise and Retreat of American Manufacturing explained how manufacturing made the U.S. a superpower and how
                    that achievement has been been dwindling. Finally, Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization focused on material foundations of modern civilization and more efficient uses of materials.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Smil is critical there will be a rapid transition to clean energy, believing it will take much longer than many predict. Smil said “I have never been wrong on these major energy and environmental issues because I have nothing to sell,”
                    unlike many energy companies and politicians. Smil notes that as of 2018, coal, oil, and natural gas still supply 90% of the world’s primary energy. Despite decades of growth of renewable energy, the world uses more fossil fuels in
                    2018 than in 2000. His work points out the modern energy industry constitutes the world’s most massive, indispensable, expensive and inertial infrastructure.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Jensen is an author and radical environmentalist. He has published several books, including The Culture of Make Believe (2002) and Endgame (2006), many of which critique civilization as a social system, explore its inherent values,
                        hidden premises, and modern links to supremacism, oppression, and genocide, as well as corporate, domestic, and worldwide ecological abuse.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Jensen is a direct opponent of civilization, rejecting the notion it can ever be an ethical or sustainable model for human society. He describes the linguistically and historically defensible definition of civilization as “a culture
                        — that is, a complex of stories, institutions, and artifacts — that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities and the definition of city as a group of “people living more or less permanently in one place in densities
                        high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life.” He states civilizations and cities are both unsustainable, since if you require the importation of resources, you’ve denuded the landscape of
                        those particular resources, and, as your city grows, you will be forced to denude an ever-larger area. He then states your way of life must be based on violence, since if you require the importation of resources, trade will never
                        be sufficiently reliable, and if you require the importation of resources and the people in the next watershed over aren’t going to trade you for it, you’re going to take it by force.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Jensen advocates non-anthropocentrism, or ecocentrism, according to which humans should primarily support the flourishing of natural communities and their many individual species, rather than the flourishing of humans alone and they
                        should extend the status of personhood to all organisms and ecosystems, including non-human animals and plants. His view, which moves the central moral focus away from civilized humans, names and chastises some of the underlying
                        values most championed by modern civilization, including technological advancement, economic growth, the inevitability of progress, and sustainability as seen through the lens of “development”. </p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Jensen promotes a way of life which is harmonious in a truly ecological sense, and is thus lastingly sustainable, such as the diverse ways of life historically exhibited by many indigenous, non-civilized cultures. He claims “the fundamental
                        difference between Western and indigenous ways of being is that even the most open-minded Westerners generally perceive listening to the natural world as a metaphor, as opposed to the way the world really is.” While indigenous
                        peoples understand the world as consisting of other beings with whom we can enter into relationship, he argues Westerners believe the world consists merely of objects or resources to be exploited or used.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Jensen argues that dysfunctional and antisocial behaviors pervade civilization, and the psychopathology of modern civilization’s global, industrial economy obliterates healthy personal relationships as well as the natural environment
                        and indigenous ways of life. Accordingly, he exhorts readers and audiences to help bring an end to industrial civilization, promoting its dismantling by any means necessary, thus challenging pacifism, since he believes violence
                        may be justified at times, particularly as a form of self-defense or resistance against oppression. Jensen has clarified, he gets “accused of being the ‘violence guy’… but I don’t ever think that’s really fair, because I really
                        consider myself the ‘everything guy’, that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance…. We can certainly parse out cases where we think it’s appropriate to have militant response or non-militant
                        response.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Jensen also considers himself an anti-capitalist, a critic of organized religion (including Buddhism), a critic of science, an anti-racist, and a radical feminist, and seems to agree with those critics who have called him an “anti-civilizationist”.
                        He has also been called anarcho-primitivistic, a label which he once accepted, although more recently he has distanced himself from both the terms “anarchist” and “primitivist,” especially criticizing modern anarchism’s herd mentality
                        and describing “primitive” as a “racist way to describe indigenous peoples.” He prefers to be called “indigenist” or an “ally to the indigenous,” because “indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations,
                        and[…] we need to recognize that we [colonizers] are all living on stolen land.”</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">With respect to the question of human overpopulation, Jensen concedes that it is a social and environmental problem, but only at a “tertiary” level, and that overconsumption—along with civilization and its ruthless, expansionist cultural
                        mindset—is the primary problem faced by the world. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="text-respon ">“To reverse the effects of civilization would destroy the dreams of a lot of people. There’s no way around it. We can talk all we want about sustainability, but there’s a sense in which it doesn’t matter that these people’s dreams
                            are based on, embedded in, intertwined with, and formed by an inherently destructive economic and social system. Their dreams are still their dreams. What right do I — or does anyone else — have to destroy them. At the same
                            time, what right do they have to destroy the world?”</p>

                    <p class="text-respon ">Hedges spent nearly two decades as a foreign correspondent in Central America, West Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. He has reported from more than fifty countries, and has worked for The Christian Science Monitor, NPR, Dallas Morning
                        News, and The New York Times, where he was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years. In 2001, Hedges contributed to The New York Times staff entry which received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting for the paper&#39;s
                        coverage of global terrorism. He also received the Amnesty International Global Award for Human Rights Journalism in 2002.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">In 2003, shortly after the war in Iraq began, Hedges was asked to give the commencement address at Rockford College in Rockford, Illinois. He told the graduating class “…we are embarking on an occupation that, if history is any guide,
                        will be as damaging to our souls as it will be to our prestige, power and security.” He went on to say that “This is a war of liberation in Iraq, but it is a war of liberation by Iraqis from American occupation.” As he spoke, several
                        hundred members of the audience began jeering and booing. His microphone was cut twice. Two young men rushed the stage to try to prevent him from speaking and Hedges had to cut short his address. He was escorted off campus by security
                        officials before the diplomas were awarded. This event made national news and he became a lightning rod not only for right wing pundits and commentators, but also mainstream newspapers. The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial
                        which denounced his anti-war stance and the The New York Times issued a formal reprimand, forbidding Hedges to speak about the war. The reprimand condemned his remarks as undermining the paper’s impartiality. Hedges resigned shortly
                        thereafter and became a senior fellow at the Nation Institute.</p>

                    <p class="text-respon ">Hedges’ focus has shifted to ever more provocative examinations of American collapse. His time spent observing conflict and collapse in other countries has made his political and historical perspectives poignant and highly regarded

He gained an initial following through an EnergyBullletin.net article <a href="https://archive.org/stream/ClosingThecollapseGapTheUssrAndTheUs/UssrUsaCollapseComparisons_djvu.txt ">Closing the &#39;Collapse Gap&#39;: the USSR was better prepared for collapse than the US (2006)</a>.
                        In 2006 he published an online manifesto The New Age of Sail. In 2007 he and his wife sold their apartment in Boston and bought a sailboat, fitted with solar panels and six months supply of propane, and capable of storing a large
                        quantity of food stuffs. </p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Orlov has become a self-proclaimed “scholar of collapse” and has written Reinventing Collapse: The Soviet Example and American Prospects(2008), The Five Stages of Collapse: Survivors&#39; Toolkit (2013), Shrinking the Technosphere:
                        Getting a Grip on Technologies that Limit our Autonomy, Self-Sufficiency and Freedom (2016). He continues to write and publish essays through his blog at <a href="http://cluborlov.blogspot.com ">cluborlov.blogspot.com</a></p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Orlov is best known for his The Five Stages of Collapse: Survivors&#39; Toolkit (2013), where outlines a model for the potential stages of modern collapse and how they may occur within the United States.</p>

                <h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI1C9DyIi_8 ">Arithmetic, Population, And Energy</a></h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado</li>
                    <li>By Albert Bartlett (2002)</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">The late professor Barlett is said to have given this celebrated lecture no less than seventeen hundred times to audiences world-wide. He first gave the talk in September, 1969, and subsequently has presented it an average of once every
                    8.5 days for 36 years. His talk is based on his paper, “Forgotten Fundamentals of the Energy Crisis,” originally published in the American Journal of Physics, and revised in the Journal of Geological Education.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Bartlett begins by telling his class he hopes to convince them that “the greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function.” He gives a basic introduction to the arithmetic of steady growth
                    and consequences of steady growth in a finite environment. He proceeds to examine many of the oddly reassuring statements from experts, the media, and political leaders which remain dramatically inconsistent with the limits of growth.

                <h5><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0R09YzyuCI ">Why Societies Collapse — And What it Means for Us</a></h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Local Future 2010 International Conference on Sustainability in Grand Rapids, Michigan</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">Tainter is best known for his book The Collapse of Complex Societies (1988). In this lecture he explains the relationship between historical societies and complexity, collapse, productivity, sustainability, and innovation, largely focusing
                    on the Roman Empire. Tainter argues societies can become too complex to effectively solve problems or meets the costs of such complexity, leading to some hard questions we must ask ourselves regarding our present day society. The audio
                    quality is somewhat lacking, but it serves as a great summary of his book and influential perspectives on collapse.</p>

                    <p class="text-respon ">Martenson is best known for his video series Crash Course and book of the same name. In this lecture he presents a condensed version of the material and explains why he thinks the coming twenty years are going to look completely unlike
                        the previous two decades. He focuses on the economy, energy and environment and explores their interconnectedness He explains how our economy is dependent on exponential growth and how quickly things will speed up as we approach
                        the end of the curve. His lecture is not as detailed as his book or polished as his video series, but gives a personalized and condensed presentation of his core ideas.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Hagens is best known for his ‘big picture’ talks and deep understanding of the economy, energy, ecology, and human behavior. He discusses how our lives will be influenced by the coming era of harder to extract and more costly fossil
                        fuels when combined with cleaner but more stochastic energy types. Hagens said regarding the talk he “finally condensed the relevant aspects of what we face into less than an hour, but had to speak pretty fast to do it. If you
                        haven’t watched one of my talks for a while this would be the best one to watch.”</p>

                    <h5><a href="https://youtu.be/dPEbIEc1n0s?t=3m21s ">Revealing the Naked Emperor – Paris, 2° &amp; Carbon Budgets</a></h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Danish Institute for International Studies in København, Denmark</li>
                        <li>By Kevin Anderson (2018)</li>

                    <p class="text-respon ">Anderson is professor of energy and climate change at the University of Manchester.He also has a decade’s industrial experience and is director of Greenstone Carbon Management – a London-based company providing emission-related advice
                        to private and public sector organisations.</p>
                    <p class="text-respon ">Anderson’s work on carbon budgets has been pivotal in revealing the widening gulf between political rhetoric on climate change and the reality of rapidly escalating emissions. His work emphasizes increasing infeasibility of keeping
                        global mean surface temperature below 2°C, despite repeated high-level statements to the contrary. Anderson shows how the Paris agreements reflect our misplaced belief in technological solutions and fundamental misunderstanding
                        of climate change. He suggests deep and rapid changes in our behaviors and practices are necessary if we wish to actually meet our goals.</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">The Limits to Growth (LTG) started in 1972 as a report funded by the Volkswagen Foundation, commissioned by the international think tank Club of Rome. Using system dynamics theory and a computer model called “World3,” the book proposed
                    twelve potential futures and environmental outcomes of the world over two centuries from 1972 to 2100.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">The scenarios showed how population growth and natural resource use interacted to impose limits to industrial growth, a novel and even controversial idea at the time. In 1972, however, the world’s population and economy were still comfortably
                    within the planet’s carrying capacity. The authors found there was still room to grow safely while humanity considered its options.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Since its original publication, over thirty million copies of the book have been sold in thirty different languages. It has continued to generate debate and been the subject of several subsequent publications. Beyond the Limits (1993)
                    was published as a 20-year update by the original authors. The Limits to Growth: The 30-Year Update (2004) followed it a decade later. Most recently, Jørgen Randers authored his own forty-year update, 2052: A Global Forecast for the
                    Next Forty Years (2012). Jorgen issues his own retrospective on the book in an <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/usys/ites/ecosystem-management-dam/documents/EducationDOC/Readings_DOC/Randers_2012_GAIA_Limits_to_growth.pdf ">article for GAIA</a>,
                    a journal for scientists:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“…the main scientific conclusion of the [original] study was that delays in global decision making would cause the human economy to overshoot planetary limits before the growth in the human ecological footprint slowed. Once in unsustainable
                        territory, human society would be forced to reduce its rate of resource use and its rate of emissions.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-respon ">This contraction could only happen in two ways: either through “managed decline” organized by humanity, or through “collapse” induced by nature or the market. The only thing that could not happen was for world society to remain forever
                    in unsustainable territory, using more of nature every year than nature produces during that year. “</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Jorgen reflected further regarding the initial report’s conclusions:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“LTG appeared at a time when human belief in the power of technology was at an all-time high. There seemed to be no challenge that could not be overcome through application of human ingenuity and effort in the form of economic growth
                        based on continuing technological advance. In this perspective, its main message was unbelievable and unacceptable, since it could be paraphrased as follows: global politics in the first third of the 21st century will be dominated
                        by global resource and pollution constraints. LTG warned that in the 2010 to 2030 period some resources would become scarce or expensive while environmental damage would become increasingly visible. And importantly, all of this
                        in spite of continuing technological advance. LTG warned that resource and pollution problems would occur because the world is physically finite and actually quite small compared to the human footprint in the 21st century. The
                        problems would start regionally, and gradually embrace the world unless corrective action was taken immediately. Man was no longer omnipotent.”</p>

                <h5>Overshoot: The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>by William R. Catton Jr. (1980)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://monoskop.org/images/9/92/Catton_Jr_William_R_Overshoot_The_Ecological_Basis_of_Revolutionary_Change.pdf ">Sample</a></li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6cWQYaJZ3E ">William Catton Interview (2015)</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">Catton was a sociologist best known for his work in environmental sociology and human ecology. His book formulated perspectives many years ahead of its time and continues to be a source of insight into the ecological basis underpinning
                    human society. He observed our lives have been built around an obsolete cultural belief system, a “cornucopian myth,” or “myth of limitlessness” as he called it, which developed when the size of human civilization had not yet outgrown
                    the carrying capacity of Earth. Catton observed a lag between this reality and the dominant worldview which has affected our rate of consumption and growth:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“This book is meant to overcome our habit of mistaking techniques that evade limits for techniques that raise them, it is, in a sense, a book about how to read the news perceptively in revolutionary times. That cannot be done without
                        certain unfamiliar but increasingly indispensable concepts. “Carrying capacity” is one of them. Until recently, only a few people outside such occupations ·as wildlife management or sheep and cattle ranching have even known this
                        phrase. Its vital importance to all of us has not been as obvious as it is now becoming. The time has come for scholars and everyone else to take a piercing look at the relationship between the earth’s changing capacity to support
                        human inhabitants and the changing load imposed by our numbers and our requirements. The direction of recent change makes this relationship just about the most important topic there is for people to know about, and think about.
                        We have come to the end of the time when it didn’t seem to matter that almost no one saw the difference between ways of enlarging human carrying capacity and ways of exceeding it.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-respon ">Catton explained how the inhabitants of modern civilization (homo colossus, he calls us, due to our prodigious use of energy and prosthetic amplification devices) are living more and more luxuriously, but more dependently on limited resources
                    and energy we have unearthed from the geological past. The result, he says, is a mortgaging of our and our descendants’ future.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“Today mankind is locked into stealing ravenously from the future [by way of] diachronic competition, a relationship whereby contemporary well-being is achieved at the expense of our descendants. By our sheer numbers, by the state
                        of our technological development, and by being oblivious to differences between a method that achieved lasting increments of human carrying capacity [agriculture] and one that achieves only temporary supplements [reliance on fossil
                        fuels and other mined substances], we have made satisfaction of today’s human aspirations dependent upon massive deprivation for posterity.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-respon ">Many of Catton’s observations were fairly prescient. Because of humankind’s lack of understanding and wisdom, he saw likeness of collapse as our current exuberant interlude comes to a close. We may claim innocence by reason of ignorance,
                    but Catton reminded us, nature does not care about our ignorance.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“History will record the period of global dominance by Homo colossus as a brief interlude. Our most urgent task is to develop policies designed not to prolong that dominance, but to ensure that the successor to Homo colossus will be,
                        after all, Homo sapiens. Developing such policies must be so enormously difficult that it is not easy even to accept the urgency of the task. But the longer we delay beginning, the more numerous and colossal we become – thereby
                        trapping ourselves all the more irredeemably in the fatal practice of stealing from our future.”</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">Diamond’s previous books include The Third Chimpanzee (1991), The World Until Yesterday (2012), and Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997), winner of the Pulitzer Prize.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">In Collapse (2005) Diamond explores how climate change, overpopulation, and political discord create the conditions for the collapse of civilization. As in Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997), Diamond traces the fundamental patterns of past
                    catastrophes, weaving through a series of historical-cultural narratives. He looks at the Polynesian cultures on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and finally to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland.
                </p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Diamond identifies five factors which contribute to collapse: climate change, hostile neighbors, collapse of essential trading partners, environmental problems, and the society’s response to the forgoing four factors. The root problem
                    in all but one of Diamond’s factors leading to collapse is overpopulation relative to the practicable (as opposed to the ideal theoretical) carrying capacity of the environment. One environmental problem not related to overpopulation
                    is the harmful effect of accidental or intentional introduction of non-native species to a region.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Diamond summarizes his methodology for the book as such:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“[This book] employs the comparative method to understand societal collapses to which environmental problems contribute. My previous book (Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies), had applied the comparative method to
                        the opposite problem: the differing rates of buildup of human societies on different continents over the last 13,000 years. In the present book focusing on collapses rather than buildups, I compare many past and present societies
                        that differed with respect to environmental fragility, relations with neighbors, political institutions, and other “input” variables postulated to influence a society’s stability. The “output” variables that I examine are collapse
                        or survival, and form of the collapse if collapse does occur. By relating output variables to input variables, I aim to tease out the influence of possible input variables on collapses.”</p>

                <p class="text-respon ">Tainter’s book examines the collapse ancient civilizations in terms of network theory, energy economics, and complexity theory. Tainter argues that sustainability or collapse of societies follow from the success or failure of problem-solving
                    institutions and that societies collapse when their investments in social complexity and their “energy subsidies” reach a point of diminishing marginal returns. He recognizes collapse when a society involuntarily sheds a significant
                    portion of its complexity.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Tainter proposes societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. Social complexity can be recognized by numerous differentiated and specialized social and economic roles and many mechanisms through which they are coordinated,
                    and by reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial “energy” subsidy
                    (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">When a society confronts a “problem,” such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of bureaucracy, infrastructure, or social class to address the challenge. Tainter, who first identifies
                    seventeen examples of rapid collapse of societies, applies his model to three case studies: The Western Roman Empire, the Maya civilization, and the Chaco culture.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Tainter begins by categorizing and examining the often inconsistent explanations that have been offered for collapse in the literature. In his view, while invasions, crop failures, disease or environmental degradation may be the apparent
                    causes of societal collapse, the ultimate cause is an economic one, inherent in the structure of society rather than in external shocks which may batter them: diminishing returns on investments in social complexity. Finally, Tainter
                    show that marginal returns on investments in energy (EROEI), education, and technological innovation are diminishing today. The globalized modern world is subject to many of the same stresses that brought older societies to ruin.</p>

                <p class="text-respon ">Martenson is best known for his video series Crash Course and website <a href="https://www.peakprosperity.com/ ">PeakProsperity.com</a>. His book delves deeper into the concepts presented there and why he thinks the coming twenty years
                    will look completely unlike the previous two decades. He focuses on the economy, energy and environment (the ‘three E’s’ as he calls them) and their fundamental interconnectedness. He shows how our economy is dependent on exponential
                    growth and how quickly things will speed up as we approach the end of various curves.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Despite the perceived drops in global living standards, Martenson offers a positive vision for how people can reshape their lives to become more balanced, resilient, and sustainable. His skills as a teacher make his work widely accessible
                    and available in many forms.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">“The world is in economic crisis, and there are no easy fixes to our predicament. Unsustainable trends in the economy, energy, and the environment have finally caught up with us and are converging on a very narrow window of time—the “Twenty-Teens.”
                    The Crash Course presents our predicament and illuminates the path ahead, so you can face the coming disruptions and thrive–without fearing the future or retreating into denial. In this book you will find solid facts and grounded reasoning
                    presented in a calm, positive, non-partisan manner.”</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">Greer has written extensively on matters of ecology, spirituality, sustainability, and future of industrial society. He is the author of many titles relating to collapse, The Ecotechnic Future (2009), The Wealth of Nature (2011), After
                    Progress (2015), and Dark Age America: Climate Change, Cultural Collapse, the Hard Future Ahead (2016), and Not the Future We Ordered: Peak Oil, Psychology, and the Myth of Progress (2018).</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">The Long Descent is Greer’s best known work and an extension of his previous, online essays and perspectives on peak oil. Greer does not expect collapse to occur suddenly or abruptly, but proposes it will follow a ‘catabolic’ process of
                    progressive disintegration, possibly over centuries. In his scenario, short periods of abrupt and sharp downturns- the beginning of which we are experiencing now- punctuate longer periods of relative stability. Like an organism that
                    begins feeding on itself, society will collapse in a series of stepped-down stages as it becomes progressively unable to meet maintenance charges with income.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Greer notes Americans are expressing deep concern about US dependence on petroleum, rising energy prices and the threat of climate change. Unlike the energy crisis of the 1970s, however, there is a lurking fear the crisis may not easily
                    be resolved. His book examines the basis of such fear through three central themes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p class="text-respon ">Industrial society is following the same well-worn path that has led other civilizations into decline, a path involving a much slower and more complex transformation than the sudden catastrophes imagined by so many social critics
                            today.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="text-respon ">The roots of the crisis lie in the cultural stories that shape the way we understand the world. Since problems cannot be solved with the same thinking that created them, these ways of thinking need to be replaced with others better
                            suited to the needs of our time.</p>

                    <p class="text-respon ">&quot;Candidates for public office, and the voters who elect them, should be required to read John Michael Greer’s accurate diagnosis of the terminal illness our fossil-energy subsidized industrial civilization has too long denied.
                        He shows how stubborn belief in perpetual progress blinded us to the abyss toward which we were speeding and thus impeded wise preparation for our unavoidable descent into a deindustrial age. We must hope that the array of mitigating
                        tools he prescribes may yet render that descent down the back side of Hubbert’s peak less devastating than it will be if we insistently claim a right to be prodigal in using this finite Earth.&quot; - William R. Catton, Jr.</p>

                <ul>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">The Accelerated Crash Course (ACC) is a condensed version of Chris Martenson’s four hour long video series, Crash Course. The film attempts to provide a context for many of the massive changes currently underway, primarily the end of economic
                    growth due to depleting resources. Martenson narrates an instructional presentation covering the nature and interconnectedness of the economy, energy, and environment, and forecasts the massive upcoming changes he sees as a result.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“We must reach a critical mass of individuals and ensure that they have an understanding of the ideas presented in the Crash Course, before any national or global solutions will even be possible. Because we are still quite far from
                        this tipping point of understanding, we must first focus on educating. Many people have already reached a place of understanding and assumed responsibility for their futures, but most have not. Once we have achieved a critical
                        mass of people who understand the issues and have taken responsible actions as a result, solutions will find more fertile ground in which to take root.”</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">There’s No Tomorrow is an animated film dealing with resource depletion, energy, growth and collapse created by animator Dermont O’ Connor. Inspired by the pro-capitalist cartoons of the 1940s and 50s, it is an introduction to the energy
                    dilemmas facing the world today.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p class="text-respon ">“The issues of energy shortages, resource depletion, topsoil loss, and pollution are all symptoms of a single, larger problem: Growth. As long as our financial system demands endless growth, reform is unlikely to succeed. What then,
                        will the future look like? Optimists believe that growth will continue forever, without limits. Pessimists think that we’re heading towards a new Stone Age, or extinction. The truth may lie between these extremes. It is possible
                        that society might fall back to a simpler state, one in which energy use is a lot less. This would mean a harder life for most. More manual labor, more farm work, and local production of goods, food and services.“</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-respon ">Connor noted most people misinterpreted the film, which was not about peak oil or energy per se, but an attack on exponential economic growth. Connor also stated he would not make the film again if he knew how long it would take, and in
                    the intervening years it became clear “people are deeply set in their opinions, and most of the writing/commentary/movies that are made simply reinforce existing beliefs, rather than change them … It would have been wiser to create
                    a cartoon about crime-fighting squirrels with super-powers.”</p>

                </ul>
                <p class="text-respon ">Collapse explores the theories, writings, and life of Michael Ruppert. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles police officer who describes himself as an investigative reporter and radical thinker, authored Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the
                    American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil (2004), A Presidential Energy Policy: Twenty-Five Points Addressing the Siamese Twins of Energy and Money (2009), and Confronting Collapse: The Crisis of Energy and Money in a Post Peak
                    Oil World (2009). Ruppert is best known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis in his self-published newsletter, From the Wilderness and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT5MY3C86bk ">public confrontation with C.I.A. director John Deutch</a>                    where he reveals his experiences observing the C.I.A.’s involvement in the drug trafficking. Deutch stepped down as director only one month later.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Ruppert recounts his life and career as an LADP cop and detective in the film, then summarizes our current energy and economic issues, focusing mainly on peak oil and sustainable development. He criticizes fiat money, fractional reserve
                    banking, compound interest, and leveraging, and discusses alleged CIA drug trafficking Ruppert also makes an array of predictions including social unrest, violence, population dislocation and governmental collapses in the United States
                    and throughout the world.</p>
                <p class="text-respon ">Critics have described the film as supportive and as critical of Ruppert’s views. Smith himself, speaking at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere, said that “What I hoped to reveal was … his obsession with the collapse of industrial
                    civilization has led to the collapse of his life. In the end, it is a character study about his obsession.”</p>
